Discrepancies
==============
1. Not all ASX listed companies are searchable
2. Data in Companies in news section do not auto update it requires page refresh
3. No tolltip for dollar and percentage values, makes them ambiguos for users
4. All comapnies and the arrow to navigate to the comapanies list page are two separate objects both with a link to the same page
	Should be one object instead of two.
